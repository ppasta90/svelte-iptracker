# üåê IP Tracker - Svelte Experiment

This project represents my initial step into the **Svelte** framework. My goal is to explore and understand the basic features of this framework by building a simple web application that tracks and displays IP address information.

The main objective of this project is to:

- **Learn Svelte**: Understand how Svelte works, including component-based architecture, props, state management, and directives.
- **Compare with React**: Analyze the differences between Svelte and React, particularly in areas such as reactivity and developer experience.
- **Experiment**: Play around with Svelte's reactive features to create a functional but simple application.
- **Build**: Implement a small project that demonstrates my interest in learning Svelte.
